To compile the cutaes program, type in 'make cutaes'
To compile the test program for the overloaded operators, type in 'make testPgm'

Due to the number of gtk windows we have in our program, it unfortunately takes 
a little more time to compile because all the gtk windows need to include 
such a big file(gtkmm.h).

After compiling, type in ./cutaes to execute the cutaes program.
After compiling, type in ./testPgm to execute the test program.

Please note, that if the student user tries to create another application with 
the same student number, but using a different name, email, etc. error checking
is done and the general information is changed to be what was passed in when the
first occurance of that student number was created.

LIMITATION #1:
We suspect that Gtk has a memory leak somewhere, as we are not able to figure
out why we lose so many blocks of memory although we explicitly deallocate all
of the memory that we allocated. Below is a copy of the valgrind results after
one optimal execution of the application.

Also, when trying to fix this issue, it was noticed that when the memory was 
NOT explicitly deallocated, the amount of memory lost was much smaller in
comparision to when all memory was explicitly allocated. In other words, it
appears that when we delete allocated memory, the amount of lost memory greatly
increases.

LIMITATION #2:
In the majority of our UI classes, we use "delete this;" in order to destruct the
current window. We acknowledge that this is poor coding practice, however we were 
unable to find an alternative solution to the problem. We attempted to pass
a pointer to that window and delete it in another class, however, it did not seem
correct visually nor conceptually. 

LIMITATION #3:
In the test program for testing the overloaded operators, we acknowledge that there 
is a memory leak being caused by the tests for cascading for both + operators and 
both - operators (the 4 lines that are causing the leak are noted in the code).
We think this is because the first function call in the cascading expression creates 
a new queue, however it does not get deallocated before continuing to the next 
operation in the cascading expression, thus creating the leak. We tried others ways
to eliminate the memory leak, however it seems unavoidable.
